# **Library Data ETL Project**
## Scenario  
A library wants to improve their current quality analysis, as manually completing the task takes too much time and is less reliable. They are looking for a more efficient way to filter data using Python and automation. They have heard of a tool called Azure DevOps and want to apply it to their process.

## Task 
Using the knowledge learnt over the past few modules, design and create a project that uses and manipulates data and puts it into another location ready for presentation purposes. Your project will include: 
* Documenting architecture design, testing plans and agile kanban for 
planning.  
* Setting up an agile Kanban board to use for planning.  
* Storing code result in a central GitHub Repository.  
* Using data provided to manipulate and clean up the results ready for the next stage using Python tools.  
* Testing the application with unit testing.  
* Using a CI/CD pipeline to automate the data transformation process.  
* Reporting security practices that can be applied to the project.  
 
## Objectives  
- The architecture design.  
- A demonstration of the pipeline and application working.  
- A talk through the PowerBi infographics.
