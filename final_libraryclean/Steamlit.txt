Will need to look into to Steamlit properly.
Fow now wanted to see it can do so used script from Claude to create streamlit dashboard.
Attempted to run it using: streamlit run streamlit_dashboard.py in the command line, but it was error'd
Claude suggested to use a different port: streamlit run streamlit_dashboard.py --server.port 8502

This has worked! 

Now that I have idea of what it can do, may need to look into using it in a project.
